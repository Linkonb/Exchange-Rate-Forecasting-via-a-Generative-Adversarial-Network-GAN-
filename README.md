**Exchange Rate Forecasting via a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** <br>
**Abstract**<br>
Forecasting is an exciting topic in every field of study. Currency exchange rate Forecasting is a typical time series prediction problem which has been solved by different time-series models. Deep learning has been widely used in time series forecasting. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has proved to be a powerful machine learning tool in image data analysis and generation. In this paper, we propose to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn and simulate Currency exchange rate Forecasting. More specifically, in this study, we attempt to forecast the dynamic evolutions of the exchange rates of Japanese Yen against the US dollar, by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) & Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN)

**I. INTRODUCTION**<br>
The foreign currency exchange market playing an important role in the global financial economy.  Forecasting the Exchange Rate is a challenging topic as a time series prediction. Basically, there are two major classes of the prediction the future exchange rate tools, including the time series models and machine learning model. 
This paper uses a machine learning model GAN to predict the exchange rate and comparison between GAN and Wasserstein GAN.
